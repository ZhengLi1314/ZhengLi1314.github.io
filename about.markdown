Hi, I’m **Zheng Li**, a Master of Engineering student in Financial Engineering at **Cornell University**.

I earned my Bachelor’s degree in **Quantitative Finance** with a minor in Computer Science from **Stevens Institute of Technology**, graduating with a **3.91 GPA** and as a member of **Beta Gamma Sigma Honor Society**.

My interests include **machine learning, algorithmic trading, financial modeling**, and exploring **diversity's impact on the economy**. I’ve co-authored peer-reviewed papers and built agent-based simulations for realistic financial environments.

Beyond academics, I enjoy playing piano, photography, tennis, and participating in student organizations like the Python Club and Choir.
